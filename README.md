# Enterprise Network Implementation (CCNA Project)

## üìò Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an enterprise network using Cisco devices.  
It covers LAN and WAN design, routing, switching, and security services.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Protocols

- NAT Configuration  
- ACLs (including Reflexive ACLs)  

## ‚úÖ Outcomes
- Full interconnectivity between different LANs and WANs  
- Gateway redundancy with HSRP  
- Optimized subnetting with VLSM  
- Secure and efficient network access using ACLs  
- Verified connectivity between enterprise hosts and external networks
